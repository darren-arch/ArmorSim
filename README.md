#ArmorSim

This sim will provide a milisecond by milisecond calculation of how fast a bullet is moving through a piece of armor. 

It will take the caliber of the bullet, the velocity, and the thickness of the armor.

It should be able to calculate whether or not the bullet will travel through the armor and some information about
the deformation.
